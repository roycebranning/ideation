Manifesto Elos
--------------

RB:

Fam, 

What do you think of this? 

All of us are searching, most of us are learning, some of us are living. 

All of us are searching. Translation: none of us have all the answers. We may conclude that we have enough answers to be satisfied, but no one in their right mind completely gets what is all going on here. So as we walk through the day, there is something in us that simply must yearn for some type of answer to the equation of humanity.

Most of us are learning. We all get caught up in the noise and so it's hard to find the true signals that can be of use to us. The noise can look a lot like the signals and vice versa. I'd even venture to say that all noise is a signal if you listen closely enough. Well consider elos a noise to signal converter. Not an absolute one. But a tool that can be an aid to that brain of yours in fleshing out what the real face of some of lifes presentations are.

Some of us are living.  

Elos will not be a platform that decides how you live your life. It is a tool that hopefully helps you understand who you are and why you are. Elos fights the "signal in the noise battles" that most of our brains don't have the capacity to fight. A tool is as contructive or destructive as the worker makes it. 

A tool : Let's think about a hammer. Why do I use a hammer? Because it is a way to concentrate and thereby amplify the force that I'm able to generate in order to solve the objective of driving a nail into something. In this sense a hammer is great. I don't glorify the amazing hammer for driving the nail into the wood, but I appreciate a good hammer for helping me do the job to the best of my ability.

Lando: 

The human species is primarily characterized by three aspects: a will to survive, a will to be around others, and a will for progress and posterity.

These compounding motivations result in a human experience characterized by love and trust and faith, by generosity and struggle and hope, by tragedy and beauty.

In setting about to improve the human experience and to ensure the continuation of humanity, one must take care to preserve that which defines the human experience.  To improve the human condition is to change it. The desire to maintain its core aspects should guide this change.

Elos is math and logic applied through a filter of philosphy on what you think is important and what you believe can be improved. Elos fights for the parts of your day that make you who you are and allots time for the parts that make you who you want to be.
